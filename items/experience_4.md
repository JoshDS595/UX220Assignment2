<h4> My trip to Portugal </h4>

<p>

- I got to go on a 2 week trip to Portugal with my family.<br>

- We went in August of 2023 <br>

- I got to see the island my families from, as well as experience the festivals and 
  landscape<br>
  of the island and meet new family who lived there.<br>

- I got go to the artificial beaches alot, which had no sand due to the island  
  being volcanic.<br>

- The trip was very action packed which could be tiring at times, but I still had a 
  great time.<br>

- Overall I grade the experience a "A"
