### High School Co op

<p>

- I got a Co op placement at an online magazine as a video editor.<br>

- I was in this position for one high school semester. <br>

- I got to learn a plethora of video editing techniques as well as how<br>
  to work with a variety of software.<br>

- Created my first ever video editing projects which was cool.<br>

- Some deadlines would be tough to meet and it was hard at times to meet<br>
  the criteria my employer's expected.<br>

- Overall I grade the experience a "B"
