### Metro Deli Department

<p>

- I worked in the Deli department at Metro<br>

- I worked this job just for the summer of 2022 <br>

- I got experience working in retail and food handling <br>

- My friend who worked in the same plaza would come by to visit often<br>

- It was a very tough environment to work in, lot's of my coworkers weren't <br>
  very nice, and the job was very taxing at times. <br>

- Overall I grade the experience a "F"
