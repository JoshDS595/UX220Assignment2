### Volunteer Work

<p>

- I volunteered for over 100 hours at the Town of Milton summer camps.<br>

- Volunteered during the summer of 2018 <br>

- I got valuable experience working at the summer camps which then helped me with<br>
  my Camp counselour job later on.<br>

- Got to volunteer with a friend of mine which was fun<br>

- The only unenjoyable part was that there was lot's of clean up work at times. <br>

- Overall I grade the experience a "B"
