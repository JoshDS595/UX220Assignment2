<h1> Camp Counselour </h1>

<p>

- I worked as a Camp Counselour for 4 years <br>

- I worked this job from 2019 - 2023 (excluding 2020) <br>

- I got tons of experience from this job, as well as got the chance to <br>
  improve my leadership skills <br>

- My favourite memory or time from this experience was the summer of <br>
  2022, as I got along with coworkers and enjoyed the camp I worked at. <br>

- Although there were nice moments, there also some moments that were tough, <br>
  with some being days where it was hard to run scheduled activites. <br>

- Overall I grade the experience an "A"
